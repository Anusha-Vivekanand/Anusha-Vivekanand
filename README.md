##  Hello World! 👋
I’m **Anusha**, a data enthusiast with **4.5 years of experience in data science and business analytics**. I am graduating with a **Master’s in Business Analytics from the University of Utah in December 2024**. I also hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, which laid the foundation for my analytical and technical expertise.This GitHub page is a showcase of the capstone projects I completed during my program, blending advanced analytics with practical problem-solving.

💡 **Swire Coca-Cola Project (Fall 2024)**: I developed a predictive maintenance model to minimize machine downtimes, leveraging over 1.4M work orders to optimize resource allocation and reduce costs. I have experimented with Survival Analysis and have robustness checks implemented.

💡 **Home Credit Default Risk Analysis (Spring 2024)**: I built machine learning models using Python to predict loan repayment ability, tackling class imbalance and achieving meaningful business insights to enhance credit scoring systems.

📊 These projects reflect my passion for extracting insights from complex datasets and creating data-driven solutions. I enjoy working with Python, Alteryx, R, SQL, and visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to turn messy data into clear, actionable solutions. Whether it’s optimizing operations or forecasting demand, I focus on creating work that drives real impact. Explore my repositories to dive deeper into the process and outcomes. Let’s connect and collaborate on impactful analytics projects!
