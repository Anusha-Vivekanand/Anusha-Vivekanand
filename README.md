## 👋 Hi
I’m **Anusha**, a data enthusiast with **4.5 years of experience in data science and business analytics**. I am graduating with a **Master’s in Business Analytics from the University of Utah in December 2024**. I also hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, which laid the foundation for my analytical and technical expertise.

💡 **Swire Coca-Cola Project (Fall 2024)**: I developed a predictive maintenance model to minimize machine downtimes, leveraging over 1.4M work orders to optimize resource allocation and reduce costs.

💡 **Home Credit Default Risk Analysis (Spring 2024)**: I built machine learning models using Python to predict loan repayment ability, tackling class imbalance and achieving meaningful business insights to enhance credit scoring systems.

📊 These projects reflect my passion for extracting insights from complex datasets and creating data-driven solutions. Explore my repositories to dive deeper into the process and outcomes. Let’s connect and collaborate on impactful analytics projects!
